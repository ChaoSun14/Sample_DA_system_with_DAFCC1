Modifications of EnKF: 
1. New files added for EnKF integration: enkf_ccpl_kinds.f90、 enkf_ccpl_grid_vars_mod.f90、 enkf_ccpl_coupling.f90、 enkf_ccpl_mod.f90.
  a) enkf_ccpl_kinds.f90: declare, manage and release relevant variables required for EnKF integration.
  b) enkf_ccpl_grid_vars_mod.f90: obtain information about the model grid required for EnKF integration.
  c) enkf_ccpl_coupling.f90: register EnKF grid, parallel decomposition and other information, declare required model variables.
  d) enkf_ccpl_mod.f90: Top level driver of the DLL, which contains EnKF initialization, run and finalization driving interfaces.
2. Modifications of the original EnKF code about reading and writing model files:
  a) mpisetup.F90: close the original calls of MPI_init and MPI_finalize.
  b) gridinfo_wrf.f90: add the direct use of model variables obtained from DAFCC to replace the original operation of obtaining model information by reading the model background files.
  c) statevec.f90: add the direct use of model variables obtained from DAFCC to replace the original operation of the middle array containing the read-in model background fields; transfer the DA analysis updated model fields to the array declared by the framework, and close the original operation to write out the model analysis fields.
3. Replace the original used MPI communication mpi_comm_world by the MPI communication enkf_ccpl_comm obtained through DAFCC.
4. EnKF has the problem that some internal variables are only allocated but not released. Add the memory release operation for this part of variables.
5. Modifications of configuration and compilation files:
  a) Makefile.dependency: add the configuration of the code files and their dependencies required to generate EnKF DLL.
  b) Makefile.conf: add the call to C-Coupler2 library.
  c) Makefile: add configurations for compiling and generating EnKF DLL, and add ‘-FPIC’ and ‘-shared’ in the compilation options.
